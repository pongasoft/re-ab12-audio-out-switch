Summary:
***************

**A/B Test your audio!**

The pongasoft A/B 12 Audio Out Switch is a 2U **FREE** utility that lets you split one input into 12 audio stereo outputs using various approaches (similar to the built-in Spider Audio Splitter but with switchable outputs).

**3 control modes for the 12 outputs**

- in single mode, only one output is active at a time and you can switch to another with a single click (or key on your keyboard).
- in multiple mode, any combination of outputs can be active at a time (similar to the Solo concept).
- in instrument mode, you control the switch as if you were playing an instrument. Perfect for quickly coming up with creative ideas or live performance.

**External control**

- 12 Gate In inputs lets you control the switch from another device
- 12 Gate Out outputs lets you control other devices from the switch (ex: a Kong device).

**A/B bank switching**

The switch is split into 2 banks of outputs which can be independently turned on or off. A convenient control also lets you instantly toggle between the 2 banks, effectively implementing another level of switching.

**Miscellaneous features**

- Each switch can be labeled independently.
- Each switch has its own volume control.
- A soften toggle helps in eliminating clicks and pops that can occur during switching.

Although designed as a utility, the switch can be used very creatively as well!
